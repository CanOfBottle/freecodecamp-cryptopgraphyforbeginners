# freeCodeCamp Cryptography for Beginners Video Course

This code is the code from following along with the freeCodeCamp Cryptography for Beginners - Full Python Course (SHA-256, AES, RSA, Passwords)
[Video Course](https://youtu.be/kb_scuDUHls)

There will not be any updates for this code. This is simply showcasing a project I followed along with.

## Installation

Use the package manager pip to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install cryptography zxcvbn bycrypt
```

## Usage
Please use the link to follow along with the video. You will make a small program with 5 options for cryptography related tools. It's a good course to follow along with if you are interested in Python Programming, Cyber Security, and Cryptography. Python itself is not really covered in it, so if you don't know the basics of Python, you may not understand what you are typing, and why you are doing it.
